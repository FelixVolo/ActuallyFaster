# Actually Faster

Actually Faster is a mod that makes the printer, scrapper, chance shrine and cauldrons go brrrrt. The best part is that it actually woooooooorks.

## Changelog
- v1.0.5: (faster) cauldrons!

- v1.0.6: fixed that multishops aren't working with the credit card while the option for faster chance shrines is active and the printer was swallowing items if you spammed it.
